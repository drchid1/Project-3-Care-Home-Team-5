# Project-3-Care-Home-Team-5

# Proposal

To create a free, open-source tool which can assist families in choosing a care home for their loved ones. There are commercially listed websites which can help in this process, but there can be bias in the information. Some care homes may be promoted on the search through paid advertising, and websites could omit care homes that are not willing to pay for advertising subscriptions. We have chosen the Dudley borough in the West Midlands as a test bed for our project. The Dudley Council has its own [website](https://adultsocialcaremarketplace.dudley.gov.uk/) hosting the search for local care homes in the area; however, this produces a list of care homes without visualisation of the care homes on a map.

We propose to create an unbiased search tool for hospitals and families looking for care homes funded by the Dudley Council. As we have taken the visualisation track for this project, we can display all the care homes on an interactive map close to the family home, which can better inform about travel. We will also be able to layer other features the care homes provide using other specialist services and options the care homes provide together with the Care Quality Commission Rating. We will also provide a statistical visualisation of the types of care homes, beds, and services the council has access to help future commissioning on the population's needs.
